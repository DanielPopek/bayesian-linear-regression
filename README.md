# Bayesian linear regression

## Goal

The aim of this project was to model classic and probabilistic (Bayesian)  linear regression using PyTorch. 

Subtasks:

- Select pair of correlated parameters from air_quality dataset
- Train classic linear regresion
- Train Bayesian lienar regresion
- Visualize results in both cases

## Dataset

Regression was buiit on correlated attributes:  
- PT08.S1(CO)
- PT08.S2(NMHC)

of UCI Air Quality dataset.
